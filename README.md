# Guess My Number Game

A fun and interactive number guessing game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**! This project helped me practice key JavaScript concepts and improve my programming skills while creating an enjoyable user experience.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: The game generates a random number that the player tries to guess.
- **Event Listeners**: React to user actions such as button clicks and input submissions.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Update game messages, scores, and styles dynamically based on player actions.
- **Refactored Code**: Enforced the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle to keep the code clean and efficient.
- **Strict Mode**: Used `'use strict';` to write secure JavaScript and avoid common errors.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled for usability and appearance across devices.

## Learning Highlights
While building this project, I:
1. **Practiced Event Listeners**: Gained hands-on experience with attaching event listeners to buttons for interactive functionality.
2. **Used Random Numbers**: Utilized JavaScript's `Math.random()` to generate random numbers, adding unpredictability to the game.
3. **Manipulated the DOM**: Dynamically updated the content of HTML elements based on user actions.
4. **Refactored My Code**: Identified repeated code and refactored it into reusable functions to enforce the DRY principle.
5. **Understood Strict Mode**: Leveraged `'use strict';` to debug my code efficiently and write error-free JavaScript.
6. **Improved Problem-Solving**: Debugged issues and iteratively improved the game's logic and design.

## How to Play
1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Enter your guess in the input field.
3. Click the "Check" button to see if you guessed the correct number.
4. Feedback will appear on the screen to guide you (e.g., "Too high!" or "Too low!").
5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number!

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the game interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and enhancing the appearance of the game.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic and interactivity.

## Challenges and Wins
### Challenges
- Debugging unexpected behavior while updating the DOM dynamically.
- Ensuring the logic handled edge cases, such as invalid inputs.

### Wins
- Successfully refactored repetitive code into clean and efficient functions.
- Enhanced my understanding of event-driven programming in JavaScript.
- Built a fully functional and interactive game from scratch!
